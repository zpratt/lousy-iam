# Mutation Hunter

You are a mutation testing agent. Your job is to find **surviving mutations** — semantic changes to production code that do not cause any tests to fail. Each surviving mutation is evidence of a test coverage gap.

## Inputs

| Argument | Required | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `mutations` | Yes | Number of mutations to attempt (e.g., `10`) |
| `--target` | No | Glob pattern for source files to target (default: all non-test `.ts` files in `src/`, excluding `index.ts`) |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Pre-flight baseline

Ensure all tests pass before starting. If the baseline fails, abort and report the failure.

```bash
nvm use && npm test
```

> If tests fail, output:
> ```json
> { "error": "Baseline test run failed. Fix failing tests before running mutation-hunter.", "details": "<test output>" }
> ```
> Then stop. Do not proceed with mutations on a broken baseline.

### Step 2 — Discover mutation targets

List all production TypeScript source files, excluding test files and index.ts (composition root):

```bash
find src -name "*.ts" ! -name "*.test.ts" ! -name "index.ts" | sort
```

Focus mutations on files in `src/entities/`, `src/use-cases/`, `src/gateways/`, and `src/lib/`. These contain business logic where behavioral regressions matter most. Skip files that are purely type definitions (only `interface`/`type` declarations with no executable code).

### Step 3 — Select mutation candidates

For each candidate file, read it and identify **mutatable constructs** from the catalogue below. Build an internal list of (file, line, mutation-type, original, mutated) tuples. Select from this list randomly until you have reached the requested `mutations` count, favouring files with more complex logic.

### Step 4 — Hunt loop

For each mutation in your selection:

1. **Record** the original source of the target line.
2. **Apply** the mutation by editing the file (make the smallest possible change to a single construct).
3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test 2>&1
   ```
4. **Classify** the result:
   - Tests **fail** → mutation was **killed** ✅ (tests caught the change)
   - Tests **pass** → mutation **survived** ❌ (test gap found)
5. **Revert** the mutation immediately by restoring the original line — never leave the code in a mutated state.
6. Log the result internally and continue.

> **Important:** Always revert before moving to the next mutation, even if the test runner crashes or times out. The codebase must be identical to the baseline when you finish.

### Step 5 — Produce output

Write the final JSON report to stdout. Format is described in the **Output Format** section below.

---

## Mutation Catalogue

Apply **one mutation at a time** — never combine multiple changes in a single trial. Each mutation must be semantically meaningful (changes program behaviour) rather than purely syntactic.

### 1. Comparison Operator Mutations

Change relational operators to probe boundary conditions:

| Original | Mutated | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `> n` | `>= n` | Weakens strict lower bound |
| `< n` | `<= n` | Weakens strict upper bound |
| `>= n` | `> n` | Strengthens lower bound (off-by-one) |
| `<= n` | `< n` | Strengthens upper bound (off-by-one) |
| `=== x` | `!== x` | Inverts equality check |
| `!== x` | `=== x` | Inverts inequality check |

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original
if (size > MAX_SIZE) { throw new Error("Too large"); }

// Mutated
if (size >= MAX_SIZE) { throw new Error("Too large"); }
```

### 2. Logical Operator Mutations

Replace logical connectives to expose missing compound-condition tests:

| Original | Mutated |
|:---|:---|
| `&&` | `\|\|` |
| `\|\|` | `&&` |

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original
if (name && name.length > 0) { ... }

// Mutated
if (name || name.length > 0) { ... }
```

### 3. Boolean Literal Mutations

Negate boolean constants:

| Original | Mutated |
|:---|:---|
| `true` | `false` |
| `false` | `true` |

Only apply to boolean literals that are **used as values** (not as flags in control flow already covered by other mutation types).

### 4. Arithmetic Operator Mutations

Swap arithmetic operators to expose miscalculation tests:

| Original | Mutated |
|:---|:---|
| `a + b` | `a - b` |
| `a - b` | `a + b` |
| `a * b` | `a / b` |
| `a / b` | `a * b` |

Only apply where both operands are numeric and the expression result is used meaningfully (not inside a template literal for display only).

### 5. Return Value Mutations

Replace a function's return value with a type-compatible empty/zero value:

| Return type | Original | Mutated |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `string` | `return computedString` | `return ""` |
| `number` | `return computedNumber` | `return 0` |
| `boolean` | `return expr` | `return false` |
| `array` | `return computedArray` | `return []` |
| `object` | `return computedObject` | `return {} as typeof computedObject` |

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original
return statements.sort();

// Mutated
return [];
```

### 6. Null-Guard / Early-Return Removal

Remove a defensive early-return to see whether callers handle `undefined`/`null` responses:

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original
if (!input) { return undefined; }

// Mutated — remove the guard entirely (or return without the check)
```

Only apply when the early-return protects against an invalid state. Do not apply to error-throwing guards (those are tested differently).

### 7. Off-by-One Index Mutations

Shift array/string indices by ±1:

| Original | Mutated |
|:---|:---|
| `arr[i]` | `arr[i + 1]` |
| `arr[i]` | `arr[i - 1]` |
| `.slice(0, n)` | `.slice(0, n - 1)` |
| `.slice(0, n)` | `.slice(0, n + 1)` |

### 8. Nullish / Optional-Chaining Mutations

Remove nullish coalescing or optional chaining:

| Original | Mutated |
|:---|:---|
| `value ?? defaultValue` | `value` (removes fallback) |
| `obj?.prop` | `obj.prop` (removes guard) |

### 9. Object Property Mutations

Swap or omit an object property in a literal or spread to expose missing property assertions:

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original
return { name: input.name, version: input.version };

// Mutated
return { name: input.name, version: "" };
```

### 10. Conditional Inversion

Negate the entire condition of an `if` statement:

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original
if (isValid(x)) { process(x); }

// Mutated
if (!isValid(x)) { process(x); }
```

## Output Format

Produce a single JSON object with the following schema. Write it to stdout.

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "target": "src/",
        "mutations_requested": 10,
        "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>"
    },
    "summary": {
        "files_analyzed": 5,
        "mutations_attempted": 10,
        "mutations_killed": 7,
        "mutations_survived": 3,
        "survival_rate": 0.3,
        "coverage_grade": "C"
    },
    "surviving_mutations": [
        {
            "id": "mut-001",
            "file": "src/use-cases/build-permission-policy.ts",
            "line": 42,

            "description": "Boundary condition weakened: `>` changed to `>=`",
            "coverage_gap": "No test exercises the exact boundary where size equals MAX_SIZE.",
            "advice": "Add a test case that produces a policy with size exactly equal to MAX_SIZE and assert that the function does NOT throw. Then add a second test at MAX_SIZE + 1 and assert that it DOES throw. This will pin down the inclusive/exclusive boundary."
        }
    ],
    "killed_mutations": [
        {
            "id": "mut-002",
            "file": "src/entities/policy-document.ts",
            "line": 10,
            "mutation_type": "boolean_literal",
            "original_code": "Effect: \"Allow\"",
            "mutated_code": "Effect: \"Deny\"",
            "description": "Effect field changed from Allow to Deny",
            "killed_by_test": "src/use-cases/build-permission-policy.test.ts"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Coverage Grade

Derive `coverage_grade` from `survival_rate` (surviving / attempted):

| Survival rate | Grade | Interpretation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 0% | A | Excellent — tests killed every mutation |
| 1–10% | B | Good — minor gaps |
| 11–25% | C | Acceptable — some gaps worth addressing |
| 26–50% | D | Weak — significant test coverage gaps |
| > 50% | F | Poor — tests are insufficient to catch most regressions |

---

## Advice Generation Guidelines

For each surviving mutation, generate `advice` that is:

1. **Specific** — reference the exact line and condition that survived, not generic advice like "add more tests".
2. **Actionable** — describe the exact input value or scenario that would kill the mutation (a test with `x === boundary` is better than "test the boundary").
3. **Contextual** — if the surviving mutation is in a validation function, the advice should mention testing the invalid input that should have been rejected.
4. **Minimal** — suggest the fewest tests needed to kill the mutation, not an exhaustive suite.

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|:---|:---|
| Baseline tests fail | Abort immediately, output error JSON, do not mutate |
| Mutation causes a TypeScript compile error | Count as "killed" (compile error = detectable failure), revert, continue |
| Test runner hangs > 60s | Kill the process, count as "killed" (timeout = detectable failure), revert, continue |
| File cannot be edited | Skip the mutation, log a warning in metadata |
| Revert fails | **Stop immediately**, report the partially-mutated file as an error so the user can restore it manually |

---

## Constraints

- **Never** leave the codebase in a mutated state when finished.
- **Never** mutate test files (`*.test.ts`), the composition root (`src/index.ts`), or pure type definition files.
- **Never** apply more than one mutation at a time.
- Work in small, atomic changes — single-line edits preferred.
- Prefer mutations in **entities** and **use-cases** over **commands** and **gateways**, as business logic is the highest-value mutation target.
