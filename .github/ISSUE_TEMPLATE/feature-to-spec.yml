        1. Review .github/instructions/spec.instructions.md for details and use this as your guide for the spec.
        2. Review all other repository instructions before starting work to understand engineering requirements.
        3. Create the spec in .github/specs directory and ensure requirements are captured in the EARS format.
        4. Create a data flow diagram and sequence diagram to illustrate the feature's operation.
        5. Break down the feature into manageable tasks with clear descriptions.
        6. As you complete each task in the spec, mark the checkboxes as complete using [x] notation.
        7. If you need to make assumptions, ask questions on the issue.
        8. Use the diagrams to inform your implementation plan.
